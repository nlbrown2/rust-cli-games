#TODO:
[ ] Write actual game logic (can only go places now)
    - [ ] Can this player go?
    - [ ] Is this move valid?
    - [ ] What are the effects of this move?
[ ] Handle invalid moves without quitting
[ ] Write tests
[ ] Handle desire to quit properly
    - replace with just forcing control-C?
    - I like forcing myself to design around it atm.
